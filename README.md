# SRM-Flavour-Frenzy
The Flavour Frenzy, a leading food industry brand that offers quick and easy meal solutions for busy chefs and home cooks, has approached my company to develop a website for its customers. As the lead developer of a team of four developers, you are responsible for developing specific modules for the website within the given timeline and with high quality. To ensure smooth collaboration among the team members, your manager has requested that the source code be available on a central platform that can be accessed by all developers. However, to avoid any interference with each other's development, each team member will work on their individual copy. The manager aims to facilitate easy access to each other's work for team members, without affecting their individual development tasks.

Technology Used: Visual Studio Code, Github, Git Bash, Azure Static Web app.
